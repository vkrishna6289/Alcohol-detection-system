# Alcohol-detection-system
Alcohol detection systems using Arduino Uno and MQ3 sensors are designed to monitor alcohol levels in the air. The MQ3 sensor detects ethanol vapors, commonly found in alcoholic beverages, and provides an analog output. This signal is processed by the Arduino Uno, a powerful microcontroller with  Bluetooth capabilities and send to internal website.
